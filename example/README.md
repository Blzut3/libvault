# Examples

The examples demonstrate how to use the library.

## Compilation

Make sure you have libvault compiled per the instructions in the project [README](../README.md). The [Makefile](Makefile) in this directory assumes the compiled files are available in [../build/](../build/).

```sh
make
```

## Execution

Prior to executing the examples, you must set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to `../build`.

```sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../build ./example
```
